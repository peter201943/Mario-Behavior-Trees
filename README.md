## Progress


### Chapter 1: Getting this to Work
 - Got all these damn notes done
 - Did a crud-ton of reading
 - Now to get the damn thing to run
 - Nothing works
 - IntelliJ just deleted EVERYTHING I did
 - Using a different editor now
 - [Running and Debugging Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging)
 - Which JDK to Install?
     - `1.8` - compatibility
     - `11` - another class
     - `13` - latest edition
 - Installing all Java Related files into: `C:\Program Files\Java`
 - Something about the `.jar` files is wrong
 - Run this File: `src/ch/idsia/scenarios/Custom.java`
 - Oh great. I'm getting exactly _612_ errors. _WHY_.
     - Apparently `jdom` is needed: http://jdom.org/
     - And `testng` and a billion other things.
     - What is this `org` namespace?!?!?
     - Nevermind, I'm gonna regex and delete any references of it
     - No time for this nonsense
 - https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/346
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50232557/visual-studio-code-java-extension-howto-add-jar-to-classpath
 - https://github.com/leonardost/kifu-recorder-tests/commit/c09792b08e9a0e44ad1d4f0ccad8d55d8af0084a
 - And now I also need a _proper_ build system in order to load the `.jar`'s properly. _uuuggghhhhhh_
     - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
 - FINALLY!
 - Ughhh. Great, down from `618` bugs to _only_ `371`.
 - Seems related to `testng`. Was NOT included as a library.
 - Strat 1: Delete _ALL_ references to `testng`.
 - Offending Files:
     - `CmdLineOptionsTest.java`
     - `LevelGeneratorTest.java`
     - `LevelSceneTest.java`
     - `MarioAIBenchmarkTest.java`
     - `MarioEnvironmentTest.java`
 - Commenting failed. There are more conflicts than just `testng`
 - Add `gradle` to properly specify dependencies
 - Gradle installed, maven not working
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18487406/how-do-i-tell-gradle-to-use-specific-jdk-version#21212790
 - Now to set the freaking compatibility for this thing
 - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11364761/how-do-i-compile-a-java-with-support-for-older-versions-of-java
 - I have no idea how to do any of this
 - How about we just DELETE these classes:
     - AccessTest.java
     - Util.java
 - No, can't. Can't even tell how many files may or may not use these.
     - attempting to `grep` for usages of `AccessTest`, this will take a long time (584 files)
         - No results (too many files)
 - Plan B? D? Z? (How many of these stupid attempts at compatibility have borne no fruit?)
 - Download and attempt it in Eclipse
     - Wow.
     - It. Just. Works...
     - I hate everything, and most of all, Java.
 - Spent some more time debugging. Guess what?
     - I could have selected `proceed over errors` at ***ANY TIME***
     - I hate this
     - I hate ALL of this...


### Chapter 2: Hiring an Agent
 - Potential Agents to Hire:
     - `C:\Users\Standard Access\Peter\School\College\3 - Junior\CS 387\Projects\HW 3\src\competition\gic2010\turing\sergeykarakovskiy\SergeyKarakovskiy_ForwardAgent.java`
     - `C:\Users\Standard Access\Peter\School\College\3 - Junior\CS 387\Projects\HW 3\src\competition\gic2010\gameplay\sergeykarakovskiy\SergeyKarakovskiy_ForwardAgent.java`
     - `C:\Users\Standard Access\Peter\School\College\3 - Junior\CS 387\Projects\HW 3\src\ch\idsia\agents\controllers\ForwardAgent.java`
 - Plan:
     - Study `ForwardAgent.java`
     - Redesign `ForwardAgent` in terms of Behavior Trees
     - Implement only the required Behavior Trees
     - Test this new framework/agent


### Chapter 3: Adding our First Task
 - I'm gonna cry, I haven't even touched this yet.
 - The game just WONT COMPILE


---------


## Design
 - Didn't have time to write an XML/YAML parser
 - This is the logic:
```yaml
# Forward Jump
root:
    choose:
        do:
            enemiesClose?
            choose:
                do:
                    enemyInRange?
                    attackJump!
                wait!
    chooseRandomly:
        jump!
        runRight!
```
 - If enemies capable of attacking, wait and step on them
 - otherwise, run right and jump (get lucky)
